	For the past couple weeks, <a href='http://google.com'>Chén Yè</a> and I have been prototyping an <strong>augmented reality <a href='http://google.com'>table</a></strong>. Driven by an impending deadline for final-project proposals for a class an intrepid desire to push the frontiers of uncharted interfaces, we threw together a couple wooden boards, a webcam, projector, frosted acrylic and an unholy amount of tape into a video-screen table that knows what's on it, letting you interact with software by picking and placing down objects on a surface. Here's how we did it.

<h2>What it is</h2>

<p>We processed the webcam's imagery using OpenCV running on a MacBook, training the software to recognize the footprints of a large set of pre-selected objects. I could write a whole post on how the code worked—but that time would probably be better spent actually making it work better. Here's a rough overview of the pipeline.</p>
<h2>Projecting an image</h2>
<p>Thanks to the frosted-acrylic tabletop, we can rear-project images straight from the computer onto the surface of the table. The key to success here is to get a projector with a low throw ratio — a projector that produces a large image without being very far from the surface. Our projector had a throw ratio of about 1.3, which meant that it had to be on the floor for it to project across the full area of our table. Of course, this entirely depends on the dimensions of your table—ideally, we'd have a super low throw ratio so we could have a large surface without making an unreasonably high table. Because our projector was completely on the ground, we didn't bother attaching it to our table in the final iteration, though that's something we would've liked to do.</p>
<p>The fun part of the iPhone isn't the revolutionary multitouch display or the A7 system-on-a-chip — it's the incredible apps it enables people to build. For our demo, we had two "apps" to show off. The first was a rather boring HTML5 canvas demo that drew outlines and labels around every object you threw on it. It was an exciting tech demo, but it wasn't that interesting otherwise.</p>
